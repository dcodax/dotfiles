# Dan Codax Dot Files

These are my configuration files. I'm using [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh),vim,tmux,cmus,tmux-powerline and git of course. I am working on Mac OS X, but it will probably work on Linux as well.

## Installation

Be careful, I'm still modifying thins!!!

Run the following commands:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/dcodax/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
chmod +x makesymlinks.sh
./makesymlinks.sh
```

After installing, open a new terminal window to see the effects. You should have your old files inside .dotfiles_old

Feel free to customize files to match your preferences and if you find some bug please contact me.
